    "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a big influence on civilization, generating social, economic, and political upheavals as well as worldwide health issues. Online discussion of the virus has grown significantly as the epidemic has spread, especially on social media sites like Twitter. To comprehend the causal linkages between the epidemic and Twitter debates and to extract significant insights, however, is challenging given the enormous volume of data that Twitter generates. To solve this issue, we suggest applying a causal topic modeling approach to determine the causal links between Twitter talks and the COVID-19 epidemic. This method integrates causal inference, which establishes the causal links between the themes and the epidemic, with topic modeling, which identifies the primary subjects covered in the Twitter data. For the purpose of creating successful treatments and communication techniques that are suited to the needs and viewpoints of various groups, it is essential to comprehend the social and cultural context of the epidemic and Twitter debates. For instance, public health workers and policymakers may create focused communications and treatments that cater to the particular needs and concerns of various groups of individuals using the insights garnered by causal topic modeling. The spread of knowledge and communication about the epidemic has been made easier by the development of digital technologies and social media sites like Twitter. However, utilizing the Twitter API to collect data poses ethical and privacy concerns. To address these, we will make sure that the data is collected and analyzed in an ethical and transparent manner and that best practices for data privacy and security are followed.\n"

    "The preprocess_tweet function in this code removes URLs, mentions, non-alphanumeric characters, and stop words from tweets as part of its preprocessing operations. The tweet is then tokenized into a list of terms, and the token list is then returned. The code then uses a list comprehension to apply the preprocess_tweet function to each tweet in the searched_tweets list, creating a list of tokenized tweets that is kept in the tokens variable. In other words, the code breaks down each tweet's text into a list of individual words that may be used for additional research, deleting any extraneous information like URLs or stop words. This makes it easy to examine each tweet. The list of tokenized tweets that is produced can subsequently be utilized for tasks like topic modeling or sentiment analysis."

    "This code generates a corpus and dictionary that will be used in the topic modeling technique known as LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Using the collection of tokenized tweets, the dictionary function generates a mapping from each distinct word to a distinct integer ID that will be used in the LDA model. The dictionary object's doc2bow method then transforms each tweet into a bag of words, where each word is represented by its integer ID and the frequency with which it appears in the tweet. The corpus that is produced is a collection of bag-of-words representations for each tweet, which can be used as input for the LDA model to determine the primary subjects discussed in the tweets.\n"

The tweets and sentiment scores are then saved to a CSV file called \"tweet_sentiments.csv.\" The preprocess_tweet function is used to preprocess each tweet as we cycle through the searched_tweets list, and the TextBlob routines are used to determine the sentiment ratings for each tweet. Following that, we add the tweet and its sentiment scores to a list named sentiment_scores and use the csv.writer to publish the same data to the CSV file. Finally, we print a message stating that the CSV file with the results has been created."

    "A scatter plot of the sentiment polarity versus sentiment subjectivity for each tweet in the dataset is then produced using the sentiment scores loaded from a CSV file. The plt.scatter() function is used to extract the polarity and subjectivity scores from the sentiment_scores list and plot them. The generated plot shows the correlation between the two sentiment indicators graphically. The polarity score is represented by the x-axis, with negative values on the left and positive values on the right, while the subjectivity score is represented by the y-axis, with objective values at the bottom and subjective values at the top. The plot enables us to spot any sentimental patterns or trends in the tweets.\n"

    "Based on the primary mood and sentiment polarity of each tweet, this code classifies them. Each tweet's sentiment score is determined using the NLTK VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) sentiment analyzer. Additionally, it specifies four categories of emotions (fear, happiness, sorrow, and neutral) and gives each one a set of keywords. The code determines which emotion will be the dominant emotion for the tweet based on whether any of the emotion's linked terms are present in the tweet. The code uses the VADER sentiment ratings to determine the dominating emotion if no keyword is identified. The code then builds a pie chart to show the distribution of tweets across emotions and outputs the number of tweets in each category of emotion."
